### 03 July 2024 (catdog_030724) 
We will be working with some pet registration information from https://data.gov.au/search?q=pet+registration
The files we will be using are located in **catdog_030724/input/animals**
#### Part 1 - Data import & wrangling 
##### Using packages readr, dplyr, stringr, & tidyr (from the tidyverse)
1.  Batching importing CSVs files 
2.  Joining data frames into a master file
3.  Removing & computing new columns
4.  Recoding variables 
5.  Converting wide form to long format
6.  Exporting CSV files
#### Part 2 - Plotting (+ playing around with the data) 
##### Using ggplot2, dplyr, readr, stringr, &  RColorBrewer, + base R pie()
1. Find out how many animals share your name! (People name their dogs Stephanie but not their cats...)
2. Bar Charts (top 10 cat & dog names)
3. Pie graphs (proportion of unique animal breeds cats vs dogs)
4. Box plots with individual data points (cat vs dog ages)
